The project is done entirely in standard web languages. Javascript, HTML, CSS.
Exactly how to go about playing depends on which game mode is chosen. A list of the game mode choices is below.

See the User's Guide for more info on how to play the game!

File Descriptions:

SlideShow.js - The main file for game mode #1. It contains code to run the slideshow of pictures as well as play and pause the audio. More in depth descriptions of the funcitons used to do this are in the file.

colorscheme.css - This page defines all the syling for the pages and windows of the project. Purples and pinks are prefered by Alaina, so we're sticking with those.  We hope to use bootstrapping to aid in the look of our page(s).

main.html - the webpage itself, it contains references to the style sheet to make it look the way we want; as well as the javascript file(s) to make it behave the way we want.
