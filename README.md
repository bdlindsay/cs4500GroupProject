#Alaina's Slideshow/Vocab Game
A production of 10x10 Studios

The project is done entirely in standard web languages. Javascript, HTML, CSS.
Exactly how to go about playing depends on which game mode is chosen. For now the only option is Mode #1 - the Slideshow game.

GAME MODE #1

How to Play: 
Upon selection of this mode, the song will start; for now Taylor Swift's 'Love Song' is the song playing but this may be changed later. The song will play while showing various pictures provided to by Alaina's family. At intervals throughout, the song will pause and whomever is with Alaina will need to prompt her to repeat what she hears. Once she successfully does so(or gets to frustrated) the resume button will play the song again. This will continue until the song is over.

File Descriptions:

SlideShow.js - The main file for game mode #1. It contains code to run the slideshow of pictures as well as play and pause the audio. More in depth descriptions of the funcitons used to do this are in the file.

colorscheme.css - This page defines all the syling for the pages and windows of the project. Purples and pinks are prefered by Alaina, so we're sticking with those.

main.html - the webpage itself, it contains references to the style sheet to make it look the way we want; as well as the javascript file(s) to make it behave the way we want. This can probably be optimized
