The project is done entirely in standard web languages. Javascript, HTML, CSS.
Exactly how to go about playing depends on which game mode is chosen. For now the only option is Mode #1 - the Slideshow game.

GAME MODE #1

How to Play: 
Upon selection of this mode, the song will start; for now Taylor Swift's 'Love Song' is the song playing but this may be changed later. The song will play while showing various pictures provided to by Alaina's family. At intervals throughout, the song will pause and whomever is with Alaina will need to prompt her to repeat what she hears. Once she successfully does so(or gets to frustrated) the resume button will play the song again. This will continue until the song is over.

GAME MODE #2

How to Play:
Upon selection of this mode, the song will start; as with mode 1 'Love Song' is the defualt choice. The song will pause and then a number of pictures will appear along with a command, such as "Find Grandpa". If Alaina successfully finds him the song resumes playing; if not the wrong selection will disappear and she will be prompted to choos again. This will continue for a set number of interrupts available from the Options menu.

OPTIONS

From this sub-menu you can reset the game, stop the pauses entirely for the duration of the song, and adjust the number of pauses. There will also be (hopefully) future options to upload new songs and pictures to customize the game modes.

File Descriptions:

SlideShow.js - The main file for game mode #1. It contains code to run the slideshow of pictures as well as play and pause the audio. More in depth descriptions of the funcitons used to do this are in the file.

colorscheme.css - This page defines all the syling for the pages and windows of the project. Purples and pinks are prefered by Alaina, so we're sticking with those.  We hope to use bootstrapping to aid in the look of our page(s).

main.html - the webpage itself, it contains references to the style sheet to make it look the way we want; as well as the javascript file(s) to make it behave the way we want.
